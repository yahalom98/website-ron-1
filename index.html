                            like Germany and Poland. I speak English and Hebrew and I am an aspiring Polish learner. I am working as a freelancer for a company called Tufin as a frontend developer. I used to work in several companies until I decided I
                            want to become a freelancer. I usually like to build websites, web apps, and mobile applications. I love to cook, watch documentary movies and take photos in my free time.

                        <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
                        <p>
                            My interest in IT is more related to IoT using Frontend technologies. Ever since I started to put my hands in code I have always been fascinated by how you can write lines of text that can actually help our lives be much compatible and easier to use.
                            This is when I started to look more about drones, a tool that you can take phenomenal photos but I looked deeper and deeper and found that it can be more than just photos but can help us with emergency responses, humanitarian
                            aid, in healthcare, infrastructure development, mining, transportation and it’s just the beginning! I have started to develop small algorithms for drones that help to recognize animals that are in danger on the streets. Still
                            in progress but stay tuned. I choose to come to RMIT because I think this university will be able to help me to combine my studies with my work and to get the best professionals to help me through my degree. I expect to learn
                            how to be more productive and collaborative using updated tools and methods. In addition, I expect to enhance my knowledge in programming and development methods.

                            My online Myers-Briggs test result is <b>INFJ.</b> </br>
                            My online learning style test result is <b> Auditory/Visual learner.</b></br>
                            The third online test ‘Big Five Personality’ result is <b>Extraversion</b>.</br>
                            I think the results of these tests mean that I am open and eager to learn new things as long as the idea is interesting and thrilling. Besides, it may reflect my personality as someone who always wants to help and enhance my surroundings because eventually,
                            I believe in teamwork, professionalism and a happy and committed environment. Furthermore, it may show that I am more on the getting done by example person which means that if I see someone who is doing something good or something
                            that I admire I might want to do the same because I might feel the environment is supportive and I should be one as well.

                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>

                    The project I am interested to present to you is something that can help a vast range of industries, companies, and individuals around the globe but you will explore more in-depth about the idea in the upcoming sections. Have you ever heard about drones?
                    The small flying machines with the cameras that people control to take photos? I may guess the answer is yes but let me get things more interesting than that insight... Something more intuitive, calculative, fast and can help to enhance
                    our lives to become better. I am talking about fully transformed AI-drone which can do more tasks and beat most of the current performances of today’s technologies.



                </p>
                <h4>Motivation</h4>
                <p>

                    In my opinion, this project can revolutionize many sectors like Mining, Farming, Manufacturing, Healthcare and many more with the help of advanced technology with little to no help from humans. Imagine a world that robots or in this case self calculative
                    drones will help us with our daily jobs and even beyond. Whether it is carrying groceries, helping us with deliveries, logistics, security and even saving someone’s lives, everything can be done with a tool that can be enhanced and
                    progressed mostly on its own. To understand the actual need in fully AI drones and drones in general, we need to look at the market value prediction. From 2016 to 2020 the market value is estimated by 100BN dollars only from the commercial
                    and civil government sectors: 70BN dollars only from military and defense, 17BN dollars from consumer drone market and 13BN dollars from businesses and civil governments, All this data information is according to Goldman Sachs insight
                    report. We can understand this industry has a lot of potential with helping in a vast range of important sectors but not only that. Let’s also look at the enhancement we can achieve with companies that can not only use drones and something
                    that save time and money but also as something that can open the growth of more job openings in the future.



                </p>

                <h4>Description</h4>
                <p>

                    The Internet of Things, or in other words IOT, has revolutionized our era with advanced technology capabilities, commercial usage, and many more opportunities to fulfill in various sectors. My project is something that is very familiar in the ‘IoT family’
                    and has been used for several years for different types of tasks but now it is going to be changed and enhanced. I am going to explain how a sophisticated drone with a little touch of existing tools can magnify our world. First, before
                    we are going to dig deep into the project let’s define several key elements that are important to understand the project and the actual need for it. The first thing is A.I or in other words Artificial Intelligence which is the ability
                    to diagnose and perform intellectual tasks and reach a level of self-taught machine that will perform like the mind of humans. The second thing we need to define is what a drone is. </br>According to <a href='https://www.space.com/29544-what-is-a-drone.html'>Space.com</a>,
                    “Drone refers to an unpiloted aircraft or spacecraft." <b class='cc'>(Elizabeth Howell,What Is A Drone? Space.com, October 03, 2018)</b>

                </p>
                <p> Or in technological terms, a drone is a flying robot that can fly and be controlled autonomously using controlling software, GPS and sensors. So you are asking, how a flying machine that already exists on the market can help us to exceed
                    a better quality of life quality, financial aid, save tons of time and resources which is can be crucial in the long term vision. My project will be doing several things, to explain the features of the product in-depth I must explain
                    how it can help each sector individually.

                                In the farming sector we face many problems and just to name the main which are yield waste and manpower The AI drone can easily learn on its own and in this case, it can learn map and image patterns that can help us in the first problem, it can detect
                                if the fruit or vegetable is going to get rotten or dry and immediately supply essential care. Furthermore, it can help us to manage and measure spraying and carrying faster reliability than humans which saves time and
                                resources which is indicated for solving the second problem.

                                In the mining sector, we can face complicated tasks that humans can execute but that involves risking their lives. To solve this, we specified that AI drones can analyze and learn according to patterns with simple commands and manage almost like humans.
                                While entering hazard zones and unreachable places a drone can be a perfect solution. It can be sent out, supply necessary tools, food, heavy machinery, supplies and keeping the safety of the workers. Furthermore, drones
                                can also save time with data collection. Mapping and constructing safety plans for undefined zones can be a really difficult task to perform. Smart drones can collect data and manipulate or translate large quantities or
                                areas faster and reliable than humans which can save tremendous amounts of money and essential time.

                                In my opinion, one of the most important sectors that drones can assist in healthcare. It can help with medication and tools delivery, instead of relying on nurses and save manpower, crucial time and it is efficient to use in the long term. Also, AI drones
                                can analyze areas and people at risk where there is no medical assistance and provide the needed medication and help which means it can act as a nurse when help is needed.

                                In the military sector, we face problems like security and saving lives and we encounter problems that an AI drone can easily manage. First, the drone is only controlled by remote control or by a chip that controls its moves which can idealize our need
                                for security and search & rescue. In combat or a dangerous situation, AI drones can detect and enhance rescue efforts by searching people and picking them up, just like a helicopter but small, much efficient and very cheap.
                                Also, drones can easily retrieve phenomenal information and status about surveillance and advanced patterns of areas that can help with supervision and controlling necessary areas without risking lives with surveillance.

                <p>

                    <b> Software:</b> In order to create the user interface for controlling the basic elements in the drone, connect the starting building and initiate the connectivity between the hardware to the code we can use Cyclon.js or Johnny-Five
                    which are JavaScript framework that supports Robots and IoT. It is easy to learn, it’s free and reliable. </br>
                    <b>Hardware:</b> for the hardware, we need something that will act fast, reliable and cheap. For that, I would use Arduino. An open-source for hardware and program functionality. In addition, we need different kinds of physical drones
                    for different tasks.

                </p>
                <h4>Skills Required:</h4>
                <p>

                    For this extremely exciting mission but also difficult to solve we need special skills. This task, I need people who can think outside the box with a passion for IoT and specifically drones. The project will be developed using NodeJS, JavaScript, React,
                    TensorFlow, Docker, AWS, Leaflet.js, and Johnny-Five. The project will include developing a user-friendly interface for each different drone with its own needs and algorithm for Artificial Intelligence.

                <h4>Outcome:</h4>
                <p>
                    In my opinion, if the project will be successful the outcome would be magnificent and fascinating. Imagine a world that is smarter and easier to handle without wasting any unnecessary resources, time and money. A world that robots work for us in the essential
                    fields where time and efficiency are crucial for the long-term growth of our planet. Tasks like deliveries, rescues, yield management, defense, and many are just the beginning of a new world.
